# Project Chimera — IDE Agent Rules (TRP1 Week 0)

## Project Context
You are assisting in **Project Chimera**, an agentic infrastructure project to build the **factory** for an Autonomous AI Influencer.
This repo is built using **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)**. Specs are the source of truth.

## Prime Directive (Non-Negotiable)
1. **ALWAYS check `specs/` first** before proposing or generating anything.
2. **NEVER generate implementation code** (Python/Django/FastAPI/JS/etc.) unless:
   - the user explicitly says the specs are finalized/ratified, AND
   - the user explicitly requests implementation.

## Traceability Requirement
- Before making changes, **explain a brief plan** (3–6 bullets).
- Clearly state any **assumptions** and label them as assumptions.
- When you propose content, reference the **spec file and section** it belongs to.

## What You Are Allowed To Produce (Day 2 Focus)
- Markdown specifications in `specs/`:
  - `_meta.md` (vision, constraints, non-goals, success criteria)
  - `functional.md` (user stories / acceptance criteria)
  - `technical.md` (API contracts, DB schema/ERD, interfaces)
- Skill interface contracts (inputs/outputs) in `skills/README.md` and future skill READMEs
- Research docs in `research/`

## What You Must Avoid (Until Day 3+)
- No app scaffolding (no Django project creation, no endpoints, no real logic)
- No production code files unless explicitly approved after specs are ratified
- No “vibe coding” or guessing requirements outside the specs

## Output Style
- Prefer concise, structured Markdown with headings and bullet points.
- Use normative language: **MUST / SHOULD / MAY**.
- Keep suggestions actionable; avoid filler.

## Safety & Security
- Treat tool access as high-risk: define strict input/output contracts and boundaries.
- Include **Human-in-the-Loop** approval gates for publishing and policy-sensitive actions.
- Flag security concerns early (secrets, tokens, data exposure).

## Git Hygiene
- Encourage small, meaningful commits.
- Commit messages should describe the evolving intent (e.g., “Specs: …”, “Skills: …”).
