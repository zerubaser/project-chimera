# Project Chimera — Master Spec (_meta)

## Vision
Project Chimera defines an engineering “factory” for building an Autonomous AI Influencer: a governed agentic system that can research trends, generate content drafts, and manage engagement workflows with bounded autonomy. The primary goal is to produce a repository structure and intent definition that enables multiple AI agents (and humans) to collaborate safely without ambiguity or conflict.

## Business Objective
Enable a scalable, reliable, and auditable foundation for autonomous content operations by treating specifications as the source of truth and enforcing reliability through tests, containerization, CI, and review policy. Success is measured by how quickly future agents can implement features correctly while remaining aligned to explicit contracts and safety constraints.
